				<p>Originally from the Bronx New York, I now live in North Brunswick New Jersey. I grew up in the neighborhood that was near Yankee Stadium, so many a summers day you would find me there</p>
				<br>
				<p>For a long time now, I have been paid as a software developer. Notice that I did not say 'I worked' as software developer. The reason is that I enjoyed every minute of it .. and still have that compassion today!</p>
				<br>
				<p>I have said this to many young people who are deciding on a career: choose something that you love to do and you will never 'work' for living. I can not imagine being forced to do something that I truly despise. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Now I am not saying it was all easy - in fact at times it was very difficult - but I love to be challenged to figure out a solution to a problem.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This career has given me the opportunity to travel around the world and have had the previlage to work with many talented and creative people</p>
